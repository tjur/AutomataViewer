# Synchro Viewer
Synchro Viewer is a graphical application for analyzing synchronizing automata.
Its main goal is to help understanding how synchronization works on particular automata, to observe the behavior of basic algorithms, 
and to test various properties related to synchronization. This should be a valuable tool for researchers working in this area.

The program visualizes a finite (semi)automaton and allows to run and observe the behavior of basic algorithms for such problems as 
computing image of a subset under the action of a given word, finding a shortest reset word or a shortest word extending a selected subset.
Moreover, the automaton can be easily edited, which helps in constructing automata with desired properties.
